# Planetary-System-Visualization
This repository consists of codes and documentation related to course project for AE-6102 (Parallel Scientific Computing and Visualization).

## Abstract
Visualization of the planetary system (especially the Solar System) has always been a fascinating thing. We plan to showcase the dynamic motions of the planets which are bounded by the gravitational field of a star (the Sun) and analyse the effects of changes in gravitational potential hence made. With a focus on the Earth, the Sun and the Moon, we further intend to investigate the Lagrange points of these two-body systems (and three-body systems). The model built as a part of the  project is be capable to simulate the motion of a foreign object in the planetary system. Such a model will not only help people understand the way planets move, but may also inspire them to reimagine the solar system in a whole new way.
